# Explanatory-Data-Analysis-using-Spark

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) refers to the method of studying and exploring record sets to apprehend their predominant traits, discover patterns, locate outliers, and identify relationships between variables. Meanwhile, PySpark is an interface for Apache Spark in Python. With PySpark, we can write Python and SQL-like commands to manipulate and analyze data in a distributed processing environment. 

This project is about performing EDA using Spark on Billionaires Dataset from Kaggle.
